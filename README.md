*** Tools used: Excel

*** The given Excel table tells about the Amazon sales 

1. I have cleaned the dataset as requested. Here is a summary of the changes made, following the guidelines from the task PDF:

2. Handled Missing Values: The columns Metric3 and Metric4 had a significant number of missing values (nulls) and were replaced with the value 0 (zero).

3. Renamed Columns: All column headers were converted to lowercase (e.g., Report_Section became report_section) for uniformity.

4. Standardized Text: The text values in the report_section and dimension columns were converted to lowercase and stripped of any extra whitespace to ensure consistency.

*** Checked Duplicates: The dataset was checked for duplicate rows, and none were found.
